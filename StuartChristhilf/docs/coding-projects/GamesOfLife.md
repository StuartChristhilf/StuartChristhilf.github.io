[GameOfLife](https://github.com/StuartChristhilf/GameOfLife): Watch Civilization Infront of you
</span>


Game of Life comprises three distinct projects, each based on Conway's Game of Life. The first is "gameOfLife," a faithful implementation of Conway's original game. The second, "Continent Simulator," extends the concept to showcase how the world evolves over time. Lastly, "Pixle Wars" introduces a vibrant, multicolored version of the continent simulation.

## Planning

During the planning phase, I researched Conway's Game of Life to extract the three rules that govern the state of each cell. The goal was to implement these rules using Python and Pygame, creating a visually engaging simulation on a grid.

## Programming Process

The coding process for "gameOfLife" involved setting up the Pygame environment, creating a grid of cells, and applying Conway's rules to determine the state of each cell based on its neighbors. This foundational version serves as the basis for the subsequent projects.

For "Continent Simulator," the grid evolves beyond a binary state. I introduced teams represented by colors, and each cell belongs to a team. The simulation models battles between neighboring cells, and the outcome is determined by random chance, resulting in a dynamic and evolving world.

In "Pixle Wars," the concept is further expanded with additional teams, each assigned a distinct color. The battles continue, creating a visually striking and dynamic display as the colors clash and territories evolve.
