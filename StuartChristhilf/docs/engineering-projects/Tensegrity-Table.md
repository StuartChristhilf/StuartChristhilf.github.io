The Tensegrity Table: A Magical Engineering Project
</span>

During my sophomore year of high school, in week 7 of [computer-controlled machining](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/charlotte/students/stuart-christhilf/weeks/week-7/), I embarked on the fascinating journey of creating the Tensegrity Table. This project leverages the incredible force of tension to make the table appear as though it defies gravity, almost like magic.

## Planning

To begin, I needed to gain a deep understanding of how a tensegrity table operates. Through research and exploration, I created this diagram to illustrate its mechanics:

In the diagram, you can see that the inner wire is the primary component responsible for supporting the table. The central wire bears the weight of the entire structure, while the corner wires prevent the table from toppling over by keeping it firmly in place. When these forces are combined, they create the illusion of a floating table.
