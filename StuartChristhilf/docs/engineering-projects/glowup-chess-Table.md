The Glow Up Chess Table: A Bright Project
</span>

During my freshman year of high school, for my [Final Engineering 2 project](https://sites.google.com/charlottelatin.org/stuartchrsthilfdigitalportfoli/9th-grade/edm-2/final-project), I undertook an emotional project to give to my grandfather.

## Planning

For this project, I wanted to make a chess table for my grandpa. He made me a chess table when I was 10, and I wanted to return the favor. However, because I am not as skilled at woodworking, I decided to add an electrical option to light up the table.

## Creating Process and Result

[Here](https://sites.google.com/charlottelatin.org/stuartchrsthilfdigitalportfoli/9th-grade/edm-2/final-project) is the link to the high school site where I documented the making of this chess table along with many other projects.
