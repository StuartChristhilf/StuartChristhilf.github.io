The Soda Machine: A Technological Wonder
</span>

During my sophomore year of high school, for my [Final Fab Academy project](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/charlotte/students/stuart-christhilf/FinalProject/), I undertook a rigorous project that required me to apply all the information I had learned so far and more.

## Planning

To begin, I decided around week 10 that I wanted to switch my final project and build upon my [week 10 group project](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/charlotte/students/stuart-christhilf/weeks/week-10/). Here are the ways I needed to upgrade it into a more refined final project. Here is the link to my work during the week that I plan to build upon. To do this, I plan to add sensors to every stop so that it is always under the pumps for the machine. I also need to take it off of Arduino Mega and move it to a Raspberry Pico 2040 for controlling everything. Along with this, I will mill my own boards for every piece instead of using a breadboard. I also want to put nozzles and something to hold those nozzles in place, so they don't move while pumping liquids out. I also plan on coding it with the math to always fill the cup, so if you press 2 drinks, it will fill it half-and-half and so on. That is all the electrical and mechanical changes, but I also want to add an area under the carriage so if a liquid misses the cup, it catches it and drains it all out. I also want to add NeoPixel lights next to the buttons to show if they have been pressed or not. Lastly, one of the biggest problems with our original soda machine was that the bottom carriage would bind all the time, causing stress to the stepper motor and the whole system. This was because the whole skeleton was too rigid, so I plan on putting a spring in between both sides of the aluminum T-bar so that it has a little give.

## Creating Process and Result
