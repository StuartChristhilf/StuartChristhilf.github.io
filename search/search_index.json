The first is \"gameOfLife,\" a faithful implementation of Conway's original game. The second, \"Continent Simulator,\" extends the concept to showcase how the world evolves over time. Lastly, \"Pixle Wars\" introduces a vibrant, multicolored version of the continent simulation. Planning During the planning phase, I researched Conway's Game of Life to extract the three rules that govern the state of each cell. The goal was to implement these rules using Python and Pygame, creating a visually engaging simulation on a grid. Programming Process The coding process for \"gameOfLife\" involved setting up the Pygame environment, creating a grid of cells, and applying Conway's rules to determine the state of each cell based on its neighbors. This foundational version serves as the basis for the subsequent projects. For \"Continent Simulator,\" the grid evolves beyond a binary state. I introduced teams represented by colors, and each cell belongs to a team. The simulation models battles between neighboring cells, and the outcome is determined by random chance, resulting in a dynamic and evolving world. In \"Pixle Wars,\" the concept is further expanded with additional teams, each assigned a distinct color. The battles continue, creating a visually striking and dynamic display as the colors clash and territories evolve. Code Here is the github link for these projects.","title":"GamesOfLife"},{"location":"coding-projects/GamesOfLife/#planning","text":"During the planning phase, I researched Conway's Game of Life to extract the three rules that govern the state of each cell.

It's not just a typical typing test; it's a challenge that measures your typing speed using interesting turtle facts. Planning For the planning of my code, I designed a flowchart outlining my code. It had a couple of main aspects, being that I wanted two data structures: one that holds all the characters the player types and one that holds the characters of the sentence they are supposed to type. I wanted the sentences to be held in a tree that I could go through depending on how well they do. I also wanted an observer that would compare the two data structures as if they were a hash table. Using this as my basic plan, I was able to create a working code that almost did everything I wanted at first. Programming Process As for the process of actually programming, I started off by programming the actual site shown in a file called index.html. It was the backbone of the entire project being what the player actually sees. After creating it, I went on to create the player list and have its inputs be made by what the player types in the HTML element text box in the index file. After I made the player list, I made the turtle tree class which holds all the sentences/facts that the player will need to type. Once I had created that, I had a little trouble making it so that you could navigate that tree in the index class so that it could be displayed on the website, but figured out a flaw in the constructors of my original tree class and could then easily navigate through it in the index class, in the process also making it a singleton because it could only be called by the index class because of the variables required to call it. Next, I had to make an observer to compare the two data structures of characters to make sure they match. This took by far the longest because of getting all the data and comparing it, but by adding some extra methods I was able to get it to be able to access the other data structures and be able to check them, and then cause the index code to move on to the next sentence.

This project leverages the incredible force of tension to make the table appear as though it defies gravity, almost like magic. Planning To begin, I needed to gain a deep understanding of how a tensegrity table operates. Through research and exploration, I created this diagram to illustrate its mechanics: In the diagram, you can see that the inner wire is the primary component responsible for supporting the table. The central wire bears the weight of the entire structure, while the corner wires prevent the table from toppling over by keeping it firmly in place. When these forces are combined, they create the illusion of a floating table. creating proccess and result Here is the link to my fab-page with the step by step of how I made this table and its final result.","title":"Tensegrity Table"},{"location":"engineering-projects/Tensegrity-Table/#planning","text":"To begin, I needed to gain a deep understanding of how a tensegrity table operates.

Planning To begin, I decided around week 10 that I wanted to switch my final project and build upon my week 10 group project . Here are the ways I needed to upgrade it into a more refined final project. Here is the link to my work during the week that I plan to build upon. To do this, I plan to add sensors to every stop so that it is always under the pumps for the machine. I also need to take it off of Arduino Mega and move it to a Raspberry Pico 2040 for controlling everything. Along with this, I will mill my own boards for every piece instead of using a breadboard. I also want to put nozzles and something to hold those nozzles in place, so they don't move while pumping liquids out. I also plan on coding it with the math to always fill the cup, so if you press 2 drinks, it will fill it half-and-half and so on. That is all the electrical and mechanical changes, but I also want to add an area under the carriage so if a liquid misses the cup, it catches it and drains it all out. I also want to add NeoPixel lights next to the buttons to show if they have been pressed or not. Lastly, one of the biggest problems with our original soda machine was that the bottom carriage would bind all the time, causing stress to the stepper motor and the whole system. This was because the whole skeleton was too rigid, so I plan on putting a spring in between both sides of the aluminum T-bar so that it has a little give.
