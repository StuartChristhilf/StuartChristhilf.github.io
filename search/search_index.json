It's not just a typical typing test; it's a challenge that measures your typing speed using interesting turtle facts. Creating the Website To kick off this project, I had to set up a GitHub page that uses HTML, allowing me to incorporate JavaScript for the game. The next step involved creating the initial HTML page, featuring the title and a text box for players to type in.","title":"Turtle Typer"},{"location":"coding-projects/Turtle-Typer/#creating-the-website","text":"To kick off this project, I had to set up a GitHub page that uses HTML, allowing me to incorporate JavaScript for the game.

This project leverages the incredible force of tension to make the table appear as though it defies gravity, almost like magic. Planning To begin, I needed to gain a deep understanding of how a tensegrity table operates. Through research and exploration, I created this diagram to illustrate its mechanics: In the diagram, you can see that the inner wire is the primary component responsible for supporting the table. The central wire bears the weight of the entire structure, while the corner wires prevent the table from toppling over by keeping it firmly in place. When these forces are combined, they create the illusion of a floating table.","title":"Tensegrity Table"},{"location":"engineering-projects/Tensegrity-Table/#planning","text":"To begin, I needed to gain a deep understanding of how a tensegrity table operates.
